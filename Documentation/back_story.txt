50 long dark years have passed… the world is no longer as you remember it… 
all that remains is a desolate barren landscape. 
Despite all of mankind’s efforts, climate change was too strong an enemy to defeat. 
A last effort expedition in search of resources has finally returned from the far north 
and good fortune is smiling upon you at last. 
In hopes to claim the land for your people, you have named the land ‘Pirkanmaa’. 
The northern land is rich in ores and bountiful in harvest, 
however neighbouring villages have quickly overheard the good news and are right on your tail. 
It is now your responsibility as chieftain to step up and lead your people out of this dark age. 
Tread carefully, as you bear the weight of your village’s future on your shoulders.
